      <h2><strong>Internet of Things</strong></h2>
      <p><em>Smart devices are going to be all around us soon. 
	  Cisco estimates that there will be about 50 billion smart devices connected to the internet by 2020. 
	  That’s 6 devices for every person on Earth! Internet of Things (IoT) is the next big thing. 
	  It links smarts devices around you such as your microwave, your refrigerator, your air conditioner, and even your car to the internet so they can “talk” to each other. 
	  Using IoT, we can manage, maintain, and access smart devices from virtually anywhere. IoT can and will make our lives much easier, safer and fun.<br>
	  Learn concepts related to the IoT, and then practically implement them in this two-day workshop on Internet of Things by Infi-Zeal Technologies. 
	  By the end of this workshop, you will learn to control electronic systems wirelessly using Arduino and the cloud.<br>
	  <strong>Duration:</strong> 2 days, during Pravega (20th-22nd January, 2017)<br>
	  <strong>Registration fee:</strong> Rs. 1500/- per head<br>

      <h2><strong>Touch and Augmented Reality</strong></h2>
      <p><em>We all have five senses; how sad that our connection to computers is “sensory deprived and physically limited”. 
			 Visual displays are gradually improving, but our sense of touch is limited for most of the time to the feel of the keyboard and mouse. 
			 What will our world be like in 2020? 
			 Digital technologies will continue to proliferate, enabling ever more ways of changing how we live. 
			 But will such developments improve the quality of life or will living with technology make it more tiresome, frustrating, angst ridden, and security-driven? 
			 Will we break away, and wander in smart environments covered in living displays, or carry a system as an extension of our senses?<br>
			 In this 2-day workshop we will explore the opportunities for surface and gesture computing with help of some live demonstration of surface + gesture computing where we will control our PC only with waving hands in air. 
			 So do come and forget the era of computing with keyboard and mouse and step into a new era of computing where you can control your virtual world with gestures!<br>
			 <strong>Duration:</strong> 2 days, during Pravega (20th-22nd January, 2017)<br>
			 <strong>Registration Fee:</strong>  Rs. 1100/- per person<br>

      <h2><strong>Big Data</strong></h2>
      <p><em>We create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data — and the data increase rate having a steep slope, such that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. 
	  Gmail, Yahoo, and several other search Engines, many websites add to the cluster of the data that are being dumped everyday! 
	  80% of data captured today is unstructured and called Big Data. 
	  Big Data is a high volume and variety of information containing assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making.<br>
	  For finding useful data and finding patterns in raw data and analyzing it, Hadoop is used. 
	  Instead of serial processing of data and killing time, Hadoop utilizes distributed parallel processing of huge amounts of data.<br>
